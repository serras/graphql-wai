# GraphQL ðŸ’œ WAI

A simple way to expose GraphQL servers built with the [`graphql`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graphql) Haskell library as a [WAI](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai) application, which then can be exposed using a server like [Warp](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp).
